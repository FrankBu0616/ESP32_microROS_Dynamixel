# DBOT

Template to build customized robot with Dynamixel 330 motors and ESP32. Motor control is managed by micro-ROS. Therefore, heavy computation can be 
off-load elsewhere.

The code is based on Dr. Rei Lee's [Dynamixel_XL330_Servo_Library](https://github.com/rei039474/Dynamixel_XL330_Servo_Library).

To run the template, PlatformIO IDE is required.
